Mapping Health Facilities in Rohingya Refugee Camps
=================

This map explores healthcare facilities for the Rohingya population in the refugee camps of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. 


Description
------------

As part of my Advanced GIS course, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, I wanted to explore the health facilities within the refugee camps. My intention was to also incorporate COVID-19 data for the Rohingya but could not do so due to limitations. Nonetheless, I hope that this tool can serve as an introduction to the issue of refugee and migrant health, the concept of statelessness, and the Rohingya refugee crisis as a whole.


Users can see how many refugees reside in each specific camp and the surrounding health facilities. The webpage also provides an index for the abbreviations used throughout the map, list of data sources, and additional resources on the Rohingya refugee crisis, statelessness, and refugee/migrant health.


This is essentially an introductory work of mine using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Any feedback to this project is much appreciated and will be taken into consideration.
